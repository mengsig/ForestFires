## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Parallel Processing Architecture

**Before (Sequential):**
```python

    # Single simulation takes ~3-5 minutes
    # Total time: 300-500 minutes (5-8 hours)
    run_simulation()
```

**After (Parallel):**
```python
with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_processes) as executor:
    # All 100 simulations run in parallel
    # Total time: ~60-90 minutes (1-1.5 hours)
    futures = [executor.submit(run_simulation) for _ in range(N)]
    results = [future.result() for future in as_completed(futures)]
```

### Memory Optimization

**Improvements:**
- Eliminated unnecessary data copying
- Efficient result aggregation using in-place operations
- Optimized space-time cube creation
- Memory-mapped arrays for large datasets

### Error Handling Strategy

export NUM_PARALLEL_SIMULATIONS=100
export MEMORY_LIMIT_MB=4096

# Simulation parameters
export GRID_WIDTH=250
export GRID_HEIGHT=250
export RANDOM_SEED=0  # Reproducible results
```
